AUDIO FILES NEEDED
==================

The Relax screen needs these audio files:
- rain.mp3
- ocean.mp3
- forest.mp3
- fireplace.mp3
- wind.mp3
- birds.mp3

You can:
1. Download free nature sounds from:
   - https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/nature/
   - https://freesound.org/
   - https://www.zapsplat.com/

2. Place the .mp3 files in this folder (assets/audio/)

3. The app will play them when you tap the sound buttons

Note: The app will show an error message if files are missing,
but won't crash. Users can still use other features.
